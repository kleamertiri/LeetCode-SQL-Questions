## Solved:heavy_check_mark: 
    
#### :zap:[1873. Calculate Special Bonus](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-special-bonus/)
Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is ```100%``` of their salary if the ID of the employee is **an odd number** and **the employee name does not start with the character** ```'M'```. The bonus of an employee is ```0``` otherwise.
Return the result table ordered by ```employee_id```.
```sql
SELECT employee_id, 
CASE
    WHEN employee_id % 2 != 0 AND NAME NOT LIKE 'M%' THEN salary
    ELSE 0
END AS bonus
FROM Employees
ORDER BY employee_id;
```
**Output:**
| employee_id | bonus |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |

SELECT x, y, z,
CASE 
    WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND z + y > x THEN 'Yes'
    ELSE 'No'
END AS triangle
FROM Triangle;
```

**Output:**

#### :zap:[1211.Queries Quality and Percentage](https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-quality-and-percentage/)
We define ```query``` quality as:
```The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.```
We also define ```poor query percentage``` as:
