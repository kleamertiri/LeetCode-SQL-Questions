I'll be solving SQL questions in MS SQL Server.

## Level: Easy
#### :zap:[1280. Students and Examinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/students-and-examinations/) 
Write an SQL query to find the number of times each student attended each exam.
Return the result table ordered by **student_id** and **subject_name**.
```sql

SELECT st.student_id, st.student_name, sb.subject_name, COUNT(exam.subject_name) AS attended_exams
FROM Students AS st
CROSS JOIN Subjects AS sb
LEFT JOIN Examinations AS exam
ON st.student_id = exam.student_id AND sb.subject_name = exam.subject_name
GROUP BY st.student_id, st.student_name, sb.subject_name

```
**Output:**
| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
